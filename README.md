# 🎨 Macro-Processor
A short assembly macro-processor script to simulate the process and show the different stages

## 📝 Note 
1. This script does not simulate nested macros... Will be done in a future update
2. In case you don't want to specify output file a new one will be made on your desktop
3. In case your desktop is not found a new folder will be created in your user home directory and a output file will be made there
